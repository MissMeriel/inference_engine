# Study 2 -- Driving study
This directory contains traces, example configuration files, and script for running the engine on all traces. To change configuration, change the files referenced in the script.
This script invokes the prior updates between runs and graphs variance of the surprise ratio for high-variance sets of invariants that have underwent model selection.

## To run this study:

```
. ./generate_driving_probabilities.sh
``` 

## Output:

Invariant output is organized in driving_outfilehoriz.csv and Surprise_To_Graph.py produces a graph of surprise variance over time for model-selected invariants with high surprise variance.
